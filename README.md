An app to search movies and arrange movie parties. Once a movie is found the user can view the details including movie title, year of production, poster, plot, and rating. They can also modify the rating of the downloaded movie which is available offline.

Used the OMDb API, Volley, SQLite, Fragments, and Connectivity Manager for offline mode.

**Note:** Unfortunately I seem to have misplaced the latest version of this project. I was new to Git at the time and I thought the new version was here when I deleted other local versions. However you can see some screenshots of what it looks like when working here: https://mvescovo.github.io/ (for the time being).
